# Regent

Inspiration for the name (so that it goes along with theme of Monarch):

A regent is a person who rules a country for a limited period, because the king or queen (Basically a monarch) is absent or too young, too ill, etc.

In this case [Monarch launcher](https://www.monarchlauncher.com/ "Spotlight Search with Superpowers") is still young and I have created Regent to help extend its functionality via the apple shortcuts app.
